                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a systems theorist and machine learning researcher. I develop and apply systems theory to bridge systems engineering and artificial intelligence.
                    I graduated with my Ph.D. in 2021 (
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.18130/vsxm-nr25">
                        thesis
                    </a>
                    ) and my B.Sc. in 2018, both in systems engineering, both from the University of Virginia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently an Assistant Research Professor and the Head of the Responsible General Intelligence (RGI) Lab at Virginia Tech.

                <h3>Research and Engineering</h3>
                <p>
                    I use abstract systems theory as a meta-theory for learning in order
                    to study phenomena of interest in general learning processes.
                    My motivation is to ellicit principles for design and operation
                    by (1) studying learning systems in general terms and (2) by
                    connecting learning theory to the broader body of systems research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My research is applied to machine prognostics, telecommunications,
                    computer networks, fraud detection, and computer vision, among other areas,
                    following themes of change and reuse, lifecycles, and iterated games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I posit that abstract systems theory offers an advantageous means of considering
                    learning without explicit reference to solution methods, and, moreover,
                    that it is able to stratify the assumptions underlying learning phenomena into
                    appreciable levels of abstraction (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14766">link</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The general systems nature of learning cannot be escaped, solution methods necessarily cannot
                    escape it, and so my motivation, in essence, follows Capablanca's advice...
                </p>
                <p>
                    "In order to improve your game, you must study the endgame before everything else,
                    for whereas the endings can be studied and mastered by themselves, the middle and
                    the opening must be studied in relation to the endgame."
                    <br>
                    - Jose Raul Capablanca
